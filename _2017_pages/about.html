      <h2 class="second">The Company</h2>

      <p>Duas Americas Group, Inc. (Duas Américas Grupo) is an American Multinational Corporation that provides business consulting, information technology, and outsourcing services.</p>

      <h2 class="third">The Mission</h2>

      <p>We found a lack of maintainability, low scalability, late meetings, and bad communication to be common complaints among executives and technology professionals working with offshore firms. After conducting research, we developed a unique methodology that utilizes a combination of proprietary software, human resources, and strategic location to ensure only high-quality software is delivered back on shore. </p>

      <h2 class="second">The Methodology</h2>

      <p>
        While developing our methodology, we found Brazil to be the premiere country to outsource work. It’s strategic location in the Americas, it’s strength in STEM fields, and it’s highly skilled labor pool makes it the ideal place to find engineering talent at lower costs without having to change your schedule.  
      </p>

      <p>
        To solve the problem of bad communication, a strong command of the English language is a requirement for employment. To ensure only maintainable code is delivered by these engineers we use a combination of required readings, proprietary software, and actual senior engineers in the United States to do code reviews before a line of code ever reaches your development branch. It’s our promise to deliver only high-quality and well-documented code that is highly scalable and easily maintainable. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Having to maintain bad code can actually cost more in the long run. Many companies would have saved more had they simply stayed onshore. With our group, you won’t feel like your outsourcing. We believe you don’t have to sacrifice quality, change time zones, change your schedule, or change your language to save money (or in many cases lose money). 
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="first">Objectives</h2>

      <p>
        Because we believe in both America and Brazil, we also aim to carry out our mission responsibly, in way that benefits both countries. So, it’s become our goal to provide good jobs to Brazilian technology professionals while helping them grow both professionally and intellectually. We only hire individuals we truly believe in. Because we believe in them, we instill a culture of innovation and promote a start-up culture that we want to go on and eventually create profitable companies in Brazil. The hope is these new companies will provide new business opportunities for American technology firms and in turn lead to good jobs in both America and Brazil.
